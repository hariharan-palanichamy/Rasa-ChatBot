### Notes:-
The chatbot has been trained to identify both correct and wrong entities in the chat.

while the bot can identify all positive entities correctly,this is not the case with negative entities since there are innumerable words that you can give for negative entities.

We can assure that all negative entities with which the model trained on will be identified correctly and most likely to get identified for instances for which it was not trained on.
